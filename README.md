# Blockchain-Voting-System (BVS)

## Main Objectives of this program:
  * To create a voting system which is **transparent, secured, and accessible**.

## A program overview:
  * Blockchain Voting System is a voting system which is transparent, secured, and accessible. The use of blockchain technology in voting systems could help strengthen institutions and promote peace and justice by providing a secure and transparent method for conducting elections, which could help to prevent disputes and build trust in the democratic process.

## Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) 
1. **SDG 16 â€“ Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions** - This program qualifies in the SDG 16 since this promotes a peaceful and fair elections which is the main focus on the said SDG. **Transparency**, a blockchain-based voting system could increase the transparency of the voting process, making it easier to detect and prevent fraud and ensuring that the results are accurate and trustworthy. **Security**, the use of blockchain technology could also enhance the security of the voting system by providing a tamper-proof and immutable record of each vote, making it more difficult for malicious actors to interfere with the process. **Accessibility**, a blockchain-based voting system could potentially increase accessibility by allowing voters to participate from anywhere with an internet connection, reducing barriers to participation and increasing voter turnout.

## **Why is Blockchain Voting System better than PCOS Machines?**
The **PCOS machine** has security issues that may pose a danger to the integrity of the electoral process. For example, the PCOS machine may malfunction, be manipulated by a hacker, or be affected by other technical problems. If this happens, it may result in an incorrect vote count and may influence the outcome of the election. On the other hand, the **Blockchain voting system** offers a more stringent security. This is because the blockchain is a decentralized and transparent system where transactions and information are encrypted in a chain of blocks that cannot be changed or deleted without being recorded in all the nodes of the network. It requires confirmation from many parties before it can be approved, making it harder to manipulate the system. Because of the blockchain voting system, it can provide tighter security for voters and voters in elections. By using this technology, it can provide trust and security for voters and ensure that the election results are accurate and not subject to any form of fraud
